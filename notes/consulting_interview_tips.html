<title>Consulting Interview Tips</title>
<body>
<h1>consulting interview tips</h1>
<p>these are tips on consulting interviews that i gave to someone on linkedin. these are geared towards one firm in particular.</p>
<p><b>big caveat:</b> this is written from my perspective as an applicant. i have no idea how firms evaluate applicants or how to reverse-map what i think i did well to their internal criteria. these are really more process-oriented notes on preparing and handling questions in the interview.</p>
<p>==============</p>
<p>On <b>Case studies</b>: My general recommendation here is quality over quantity. I think a lot of people start drilling dozens of cases and try to memorize all sorts of frameworks, but I was in a time crunch and just focused on taking a few cases from the McK website (e.g. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/interviewing/beautify" target="_blank">this sample case</a>) and thoroughly engaging with them. (This is similar to practicing math - instead of half-attempting several problems and glancing at solutions, it's better to struggle with the a few problems and fully understand how to solve them.)</p>

<p>For specifics, usually you get three types of questions, and each may have follow ups:</p>

<ol><li>The framework question - you'll get a bunch of info outfront, and then be asked something like "what all would you consider when working with the client." In the sample case I linked, you'll see the sample answer has a few bullet points on possible factors. What helped me out a lot was trying to come up with a two-dimensional framework/table, where you can hone in on each entry. E.g., for the case I linked, you could have Internal Factors/External Factors for the columns, and then (spitballing here) Personnel, Competitors, and Training for the rows. Then you can hone in on intersections like Internal + Training (e.g. does the boutique have sufficient resources to train its employees?) or External + Personnel (e.g. are there competitors who may draw talented employees away?). This question is really an exercise in brainstorming - it's also part of why I don't recommend just drilling cases and memorizing frameworks, since you want to be prepared to react in the moment to the information given to you and really think about it. The time crunch also plays in here - you have like two minutes (more on this later) to come up with the framework. It's better I think to spend the full time thinking for yourself about the actual company and actual market, instead of spending 30-45 seconds trying to recall similar cases/frameworks and spending the small remaining time on the specific case.</li> 

<li>Some graph/figure that you have to interpret. For these, give first- and second-order insights. First-order - just say what the figure shows (e.g. "This figure clearly shows that China/India are strong suppliers of XYZ"). Second-order - this is like the "so what" or bigger-picture insights beyond the graph. Here, you might want to interpret data from the figure to make broader recommendations (e.g. "We also see that Latin America has low total production, but a big growth rate in XYZ manufacturing - therefore, I recommend investing early in Latin America due to the growth rate and potential lack of competitors").</li>

<li>The math question - just practice a few of these. Take your time and develop your own system to organize the calculations - the biggest room for mistake is not being organized in your math and getting tripped up on the numbers. You can ask the interviewer for clarification/confirmation of numbers. Also, play with using scientific notation for some of the calculations - this can help with magnitude errors (e.g. you got 40k, but the answer was really 4k).</li>
</ol>

<p>On <b>Timing</b>: Take your full prep time for each question, usually up to two minutes. If you're taking too long, your interviewer will chime in and ask what you got. This is what happened for most of my questions, so I don't think it really harms you - it's way more important that you have a solid and thorough response rather than a quick one.</p>

<p>At McKinsey, you also will have a personal experience interview, touching on three categories: Personal Impact, Entrepreneurial Drive, and Inclusive Leadership. See <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/interviewing" target="_blank">here for more information.</a> Some comments:</p>
<ul><li>Generally, prepare two (or even three) examples for each category. Don't memorize (this is a big theme if you haven't noticed!), but be prepared to speak honestly and in detail about each example. Your examples don't have to be super flashy or impressive - for instance, I talked about my acapella group for a few of them.</li>
<li>For clarifications and advice on the three categories (they are kinda vague going just by the titles), see here <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/mckinsey-recruiting-podcast" target="_blank">here for McKinsey recruiting podcasts</a> specifically the podcast "Amy and Caro on the Personal Experience Interview at McKinsey."</li>
